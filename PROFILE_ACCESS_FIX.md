# Profile Page Access Issues - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem
Users are unable to access the profile page and sometimes get redirected to the "not found" page.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. **AuthGuard Logic Issues**
- ❌ **Bug**: `router.forward()` method doesn't exist in Next.js
- ✅ **Fix**: Changed to `router.push('/')` for proper redirection
- ❌ **Bug**: Race condition when profile is null but user exists
- ✅ **Fix**: Allow temporary access while profile loads

### 2. **Route Group Handling**
- ❌ **Bug**: AuthGuard couldn't properly handle Next.js route groups like `(auth)`
- ✅ **Fix**: Enhanced route matching to handle grouped routes
- ✅ **Added**: Specific logic to match `/profile` regardless of route grouping

### 3. **Authentication Flow**
- ❌ **Bug**: Global AuthGuard was too restrictive
- ✅ **Fix**: Made AuthProvider opt-in with `requireAuth={false}` by default
- ✅ **Added**: Dedicated `(auth)/layout.jsx` for authenticated routes

## Files Modified

### 1. `components/AuthGuard.jsx`
- Fixed router method calls
- Improved route matching for grouped routes
- Added better handling for profile loading states
- Enhanced fallback logic for unknown routes

### 2. `app/layout.js`
- Changed AuthProvider to `requireAuth={false}` for better control
- Added DebugAuth component for development debugging

### 3. `app/(auth)/layout.jsx` (NEW)
- Dedicated layout for authenticated routes
- Handles authentication checking specifically for auth-required pages
- Provides proper loading states and redirects

### 4. `components/DebugAuth.jsx` (NEW)
- Development-only debugging component
- Shows current route, auth state, and user info
- Helps troubleshoot routing issues

## How the Fix Works

### Route Resolution
1. **Direct Match**: `/profile` → Found in permissions
2. **Group Cleaning**: `/auth/profile` → Cleaned to `/profile` → Found
3. **Fallback Matching**: Any path containing "profile" → Matches `/profile` rule

### Authentication Flow
1. **Public Routes**: No authentication required
2. **Auth Routes**: Protected by `(auth)/layout.jsx`
3. **Conditional Access**: Routes like profile allow temporary access while profile loads

### Better Error Handling
- No immediate redirects when profile is loading
- Graceful fallbacks for authentication timing issues
- Clear loading states for better UX

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Profile Page Access
```javascript
// Test direct navigation
window.location.href = '/profile'

// Test programmatic navigation
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
const router = useRouter()
router.push('/profile')
```

### 2. Authentication States
- ✅ **Not logged in**: Should redirect to home
- ✅ **Logged in, profile loading**: Should show loading state
- ✅ **Logged in, profile loaded**: Should show profile page
- ✅ **Wrong role**: Should show not found (if applicable)

### 3. Debug Information
In development mode, check the debug panel in the bottom-right corner:
- Route path should be correct
- User and profile states should be accurate
- Loading states should be reasonable

## Common Issues After Fix

### 1. **Caching Issues**
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Browser Cache**
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- Clear browser cache and cookies

### 3. **Authentication State**
```javascript
// Check authentication in browser console
import { supabase } from './lib/supabaseClient'
const { data } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
console.log('Session:', data.session)
```

## Route Permissions

Current permissions for profile access:
```javascript
'/profile': { roles: ['student', 'tutor', 'admin'] }
```

### To Allow Guest Access (if needed):
```javascript
'/profile': { roles: ['student', 'tutor', 'admin', 'guest'] }
```

## Additional Debugging

### Enable Debug Mode
The `DebugAuth` component shows in development mode:
- Current route path
- Loading state
- User authentication status
- Profile data availability
- User role

### Manual Testing
1. **Sign in** to your application
2. **Navigate to** `/profile` directly in the URL
3. **Check** that you're not redirected to not-found
4. **Verify** the profile page loads properly
5. **Test** navigation from other pages to profile

## Prevention

### For Future Development
1. **Test authentication flows** when adding new routes
2. **Use the debug component** to verify auth states
3. **Check route permissions** in AuthGuard when adding protected routes
4. **Test with different user roles** to ensure proper access control

## Files to Monitor
- `components/AuthGuard.jsx` - Main authentication logic
- `app/(auth)/layout.jsx` - Auth-required route protection
- `contexts/UserContext.jsx` - User state management
- `components/AuthProvider.jsx` - Authentication provider

The profile page should now be accessible without unexpected redirects to the not-found page!
