# Form Auto-Currency and Persistence Features

## üéØ Implemented Features

### 1. **Auto-Currency Detection Based on User's Country**
- **File**: `/lib/countryToCurrency.js` - Comprehensive country-to-currency mapping
- **Integration**: `budget-preferences-step.jsx` automatically sets currency based on user's address
- **Logic**: When user's profile contains a country, the system suggests the appropriate currency
- **Fallback**: Defaults to USD if country not found or no profile data
- **Coverage**: Supports 60+ countries with their appropriate currencies

### 2. **Form Data Persistence (Auto-Save)**
- **File**: `/lib/formPersistence.js` - Robust form persistence utility
- **Features**:
  - Auto-saves form data to localStorage every 1 second (debounced)
  - Restores data when user returns to form
  - Clears sensitive data (phone, email) from saved data for privacy
  - Expires saved data after 7 days
  - Shows notification when restored data is loaded
  - Allows user to start fresh if needed

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Visual Feedback**: Blue alert shown when saved data is restored
- **Privacy**: Sensitive fields (phone, email, file uploads) are excluded from persistence
- **Performance**: Debounced saving prevents excessive localStorage writes
- **Cleanup**: Auto-clears saved data after successful form submission

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Currency Auto-Detection Flow
1. User profile loads with address data
2. `getCurrencyByCountry()` function maps country to currency
3. Form automatically updates currency if not manually set
4. Supports fuzzy matching for country name variations

### Form Persistence Flow
1. Form watches for changes using React Hook Form's `watch()`
2. Changes are debounced and saved to localStorage
3. On page load, saved data is restored if available
4. User can choose to keep restored data or start fresh
5. Data is cleared after successful submission

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Saved in localStorage as 'tutorRequestForm'
{
  data: { /* sanitized form data */ },
  timestamp: 1691337600000,
  version: '1.0'
}
```

## üåü Benefits

### For Users
- **No Data Loss**: Accidentally refresh or navigate away without losing progress
- **Convenience**: Currency automatically matches their location
- **Privacy**: Sensitive data isn't persistently stored
- **Choice**: Can start fresh if they want to

### For Business
- **Higher Conversion**: Reduced form abandonment due to data loss
- **Better UX**: Localized currency reduces confusion
- **User Retention**: Easier to continue incomplete forms

## üé® User Interface

### Currency Selection
- Expanded currency list (16 currencies vs 5 previously)
- Auto-selection based on country with visual feedback
- Manual override still available

### Persistence Notification
```jsx
// Shows when saved data is restored
<Alert className="mb-6 border-blue-200 bg-blue-50">
  <Info className="h-4 w-4 text-blue-600" />
  <AlertDescription>
    We've restored your previously saved form data. 
    You can continue from where you left off.
    <Button onClick={startFresh}>Start fresh instead</Button>
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>
```

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Data Sanitization
- Phone numbers are NOT saved
- Email addresses are NOT saved  
- File uploads are NOT saved
- Only form preferences and content are persisted

### Data Expiration
- Saved data expires after 7 days
- Automatic cleanup prevents stale data accumulation

## üì± Usage Examples

### Auto-Currency Detection
```javascript
// User from Germany automatically gets EUR
// User from Japan automatically gets JPY
// User from India automatically gets INR
// Falls back to USD if country not recognized
```

### Persistence Scenarios
- User fills out 80% of form, accidentally closes browser
- Returns next day, form is exactly as they left it
- Continues from where they stopped, submits successfully
- Saved data is automatically cleared

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Sync Across Devices**: Use user account to sync form data
2. **Smart Suggestions**: Learn from user patterns
3. **Progressive Auto-Save**: Save only completed sections
4. **Offline Support**: Continue filling form without internet
5. **Form Analytics**: Track completion rates and drop-off points

### Additional Currencies
- Easy to add more currencies to both mapping and selection list
- Regional variations can be supported (e.g., different dollars)

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Adding New Countries/Currencies
1. Update `countryToCurrency.js` mapping
2. Add currency to `currencies` array in `budget-preferences-step.jsx`
3. Test auto-detection with new country

### Adjusting Persistence Settings
```javascript
// In FormPersistence constructor
const maxAge = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 7 days
const saveDelay = 1000; // 1 second debounce
```

This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly form experience that respects privacy while preventing data loss and improving localization.
