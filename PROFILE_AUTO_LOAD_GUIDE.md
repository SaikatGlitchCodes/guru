# Profile Auto-Load Implementation

## Overview
The website now automatically shows the user's profile dashboard when they visit the homepage while authenticated, instead of showing the marketing homepage.

## How It Works

### 1. **Conditional Homepage Rendering**
- **Not Authenticated**: Shows the regular marketing homepage with hero section, featured tutors, etc.
- **Authenticated**: Shows a personalized profile dashboard with user information and quick actions

### 2. **Profile Dashboard Features**
- **Welcome Header**: Personalized greeting with user avatar and role
- **Quick Stats**: Profile completion, messages, role-specific actions
- **Quick Actions**: Role-based shortcuts (Find Tutors for students, View Jobs for tutors)
- **Account Summary**: Email, role, status, and coin balance

### 3. **Smart Loading States**
- Shows loading while authentication state is being determined
- Waits for profile data to load before showing dashboard
- Graceful fallback to marketing page if no user or profile

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/page.js`
```javascript
// Added conditional rendering based on authentication state
export default function HomePage() {
  const { user, profile, loading } = useUser()
  
  // Show profile dashboard if authenticated
  if (user && profile && !loading) {
    return <ProfileDashboard />
  }
  
  // Show regular homepage for guests
  return (
    // ... existing homepage content
  )
}
```

### 2. `components/ProfileDashboard.jsx` (NEW)
- Personalized dashboard component
- Role-based quick actions
- Profile statistics and account summary
- Direct links to common tasks

### 3. `components/AutoProfileRedirect.jsx` (CREATED BUT NOT USED)
- Alternative approach for automatic redirection
- Available if you prefer redirect over in-place dashboard

## User Experience

### For New Visitors (Not Authenticated)
1. See marketing homepage with hero section
2. Can browse featured tutors and subjects
3. Sign up or sign in options available

### For Returning Users (Authenticated)
1. **Immediate Profile View**: See personalized dashboard right away
2. **Quick Actions**: Easy access to common tasks based on role
3. **Profile Stats**: See completion percentage, messages, etc.
4. **Role-Specific Content**: Different content for students vs tutors

## Role-Based Dashboard Content

### Students See:
- **Find Tutors** quick action
- **Request a Tutor** link
- **Browse Tutors** option
- Profile completion status

### Tutors See:
- **View Available Jobs** quick action
- **My Students** link
- **Tutor Jobs** access
- Earnings and rating information

### All Users See:
- Profile completion percentage
- Messages center
- Account summary
- Settings access

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Value**: Users see relevant content immediately
2. **Personalization**: Content tailored to user role and status
3. **Efficiency**: Quick access to common tasks
4. **Engagement**: Users more likely to use the platform actively

## Testing

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Visit as guest**: Should see marketing homepage
2. **Sign in and visit homepage**: Should see profile dashboard
3. **Switch between users**: Dashboard should update accordingly
4. **Different roles**: Content should change based on student/tutor role

### Debug Information:
- Use the debug panel (bottom-right in development) to see:
  - Authentication state
  - Profile loading status
  - Current user role
  - Route information

## Customization Options

### To Disable Auto-Profile Dashboard:
```javascript
// In app/page.js, comment out the conditional rendering:
// if (user && profile && !loading) {
//   return <ProfileDashboard />
// }
```

### To Use Redirect Instead:
1. Add `AutoProfileRedirect` component to layout
2. Remove conditional rendering from homepage
3. Users will be redirected to `/profile` instead

### To Customize Dashboard:
- Edit `components/ProfileDashboard.jsx`
- Add/remove sections as needed
- Modify role-based content
- Update styling and layout

## Browser Behavior
- **First Visit**: Marketing homepage
- **After Sign In**: Profile dashboard
- **Page Refresh**: Maintains dashboard view if authenticated
- **Sign Out**: Returns to marketing homepage

The profile now loads automatically when users visit the website, providing immediate access to their personalized dashboard and relevant actions!
